        <p><b>Game Play:</b> Players alternate throwing 3 darts at the board trying to achieve the highest possible scoring hand. The next player
        must score higher then the player in front of them, if the throwing player fails to do that then they lose a life,
        but if the throwing player successfully scores higer then they do not lose a life and the next player throws their darts.
        Typically games are played with a defined number of lives(we usually use 5). Game play continues until there is only
        one player left with lives.
