    <div class="game">
        <p><b>Game Play:</b> Players each take turns throwing three darts, starting with the 1. Once all players have thrown at the 1,
        the start of the next round players will throw at the 2. The game continues until all players have throw at the numbers
        1 through 9 (like innings in a baseball game).
        </p>
        <p><b>Scoring:</b> As players throw at the numbers 1 - 9, scoring works as a single is 1, a double is 2, and a treble is 3. Players 
        record their score, and whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.
        </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> As we play the game, there are a few exceptions. If a player successfully lands three darts in the number they
        are shooting for (single,double or treble), then that players hits a "home run" and darts are returned to hand and
        that player gets to re-shoot for that number.
        <br>
        Also, once the 9th inning has been reached if there is a tie, then the tieing players go into "extra innings". Gameplay
        is then continued onto the 10 (maybe 11, 12, etc...) in a sudden death format. Both players shoot their 3 darts, and whoever
        has the most points, win.
