        <p><b>Game Play:</b> Players take turns throwing three darts at the board, hitting the numbers 15 through
        20; bulls-eye included. The game requires players to "close" the numbers by hitting them three times,
        once a player has all numbers "closed" the game ends. If a player hits a number outside of the 15 through
        20 and bulls-eye then it doesn't have any effect to their score.
        </p>
        <p><b>Scoring:</b> If a player hits a single, it accounts for 1 mark on a number, a double counts as 2, and
        a treble counts as 3. Once a number has been "closed" by one player, it remains open for that player
        to score points on that number until all other players have "closed" the number. Ultimately the player
        who "closes" out all their numbers first win, unless another player has accumulated points (hit an open
        number more then three times). The game continues then until either the player without the numbers "closed", closes
        their respective numbers or the player with all numbers "closed" accumulates more points.
        </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> When it comes to the bulls-eye, a true bulls-eye is worth 2 of the 3 required marks for bull and a cow is 
        worth 1 of the 3 required.
