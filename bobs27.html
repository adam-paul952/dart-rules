        <p><b>Game Play:</b> Bob's 27 was designed as a practice game for players who want to strengthen hitting doubles, which is a 
        necessity for completeing a game of X01. Each player begins by shooting 3 darts into the double 1, next round the
        double 2 and so on until bulls-eye.
        </p>
        <p><b>Scoring:</b> Each player begins the game with 27 points. Players are awarded points for each successful double hit on the
        number they are shooting for (ie. A player shooting at the 1, hits all 3 doubles then they get 6 points). If no 
        doubles are hit on a turn then the player loses the amount of points for one double (ie. If a player is shooting 
        at the 1 and miss all 3 darts then they lose 2 points.) If a player reaches 0 or less points then the game is over
        for that player, and players with remaining points continue on. the maximum amount of points a player can recieve is 
        1437.
        </p>
        <p>Just as an FYI, your score should always be an odd number.</p>
