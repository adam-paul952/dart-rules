**Inspiration:**

This is a general run-down of a few different games of darts. Games may be known as other names to different people, these are just the names that we use. My hopes are that if you have a new player to the game, or even don't know a specific game, that this guide will both inform new players of a few different types of games or if you're a regular player maybe give you a new game to try.
