## Dart Scoreboard Server

---

### **Description**

This project is a Node.js, Express.js, REST API that accompanies my React application [Dart-Scoreboard](https://github.com/adam-paul952/dart-scoreboard).

The scoreboard alone will only hold player names until the browser is closed. This application allows users to create a profile and add players into a database. Users can then select which players they would like to select to play the game with.

#### **Getting Started**

In order to use this database you'll need to install MySQL, here is a great starter link by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp).

Once that is up and running, you have to open `db.js` and change the variables under the `connection` to your own credentials.
